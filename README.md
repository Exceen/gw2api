# gw2api
Python wrapper for the official GW2 API v2.0

# API key
For some calls an api-key is required. You can create one on https://account.arena.net/applications.

In my case I have an own file for this as you can see below the imports. If you want do to that as well, then you'll need to create a structure like this:

/some/path/gw2api/gw2api.py

/some/path/gw2apikey

The gw2apikey file is a simple text file which contains the api-key in the first line and nothing more.
